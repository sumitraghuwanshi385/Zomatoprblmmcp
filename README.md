# 🍔 Zomato Order Decision System using AI

A Python implementation of a **McCulloch-Pitts Neuron** that decides whether to place a food order on Zomato based on three key factors.

## 🤖 How It Works

This AI model uses a simple neural network approach with:
- **Input Features**: Hunger, Distance, Affordability
- **Weights**: [0.5, 0.3, 0.2] (respectively)
- **Threshold**: 0.5

If the weighted sum of inputs ≥ threshold, it recommends placing an order (1), else not (0).

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ Simple and intuitive AI model
- ✅ Based on McCulloch-Pitts neuron concept
- ✅ Customizable weights and threshold
- ✅ Easy to understand and modify

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/zomato-order-neuron.git
cd zomato-order-neuron
